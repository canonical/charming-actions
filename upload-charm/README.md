# canonical/charming-actions/upload-charm

This action is used to upload a charm to charmhub.io.

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Upload charm to charmhub
  uses: canonical/charming-actions/upload-charm@1.0.0
  with:
    credentials: '${{ secrets.CHARMHUB_TOKEN }}'
    github-token: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
    channel: '${{ steps.channel.outputs.name }}'
```

## Charm Resources

### OCI Image

When uploading a charm with OCI image resources, the action will try to upload the OCI image to Charmhub
and attach it to the release. If the image already exists in Charmhub, then it will use an existing revision
corresponding to that image. It is possible to disable this behavior using either `upload-image: false`
or by providing `resource-overrides` pointing at a specific existing revision.

### Files

When uploading a charm with file resources, the most recent resource will be attached to the release.
If you want to use a new resource, you'll have to cut a new resource revision **prior** to running the action.
